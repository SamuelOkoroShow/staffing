# redux-playground

Messing about with [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux), so I can answer a few questions I have after spending a few years building large SPAs with other libraries. There's a bunch of useful info out there, but hopefully there are a few bits and pieces others might find helpful here too :smile:

## description

The core of the app is based on Redux's [counter example](https://github.com/rackt/redux/tree/master/examples/counter). I'm gradually trying to solve each of the following:

- ES2015
- Hot reloading
- Redux devtools
- Unit testing
- Routing
- Auth flow
- Async API calls

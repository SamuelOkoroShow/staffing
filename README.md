_Work in progress_

Messing about with [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux), so I can answer a few questions I have after spending a few years building large SPAs with other libraries. There's a bunch of useful info out there, but hopefully there are a few bits and pieces others might find helpful here too.

## Features

The app is based on Redux's [counter example](https://github.com/rackt/redux/tree/master/examples/counter), and includes:

- The ability to use ES2015+ syntax via [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
- Hot reloading React classes via [react-transform-hmr](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-hmr)
- Live editing time travel via [Redux DevTools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools)
- Routing via [redux-simple-router](https://github.com/jlongster/redux-simple-router)
- _TODO_ Auth flow
- _TODO_ Async API calls
- _TODO_ Unit testing
- _TODO_ CSS modules

## Running

1. Clone the repo
2. `npm install` the dependencies
3. Run `npm start`
4. Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.
